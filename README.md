# jsPsychExperiment2
A jsPsych recognition experiment of DRM category words and distinct, semantic outliers.

## Purpose

This experiment was part of my MA thesis. Data collected was compared to performance of an instance-based model of human memory, MINERVA 2, coupled with vector-based representations of word meaning derived from BEAGLE and LSA.

Participants were asked to study distinctive words that were embedded in eight different categorized DRM lists. At test, three different types of lures were presented: distinct related lures, categorical related lures, and unrelated lures.
